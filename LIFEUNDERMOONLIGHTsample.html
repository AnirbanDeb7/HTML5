     <section id="s1"> <h3>SECTION 1</h3> <p>"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall." -Nelson Mandela.<p></p>Life is one word that comes with multiple meanings and experiences. Above all life is not just about existence but also about how an individual defines that existence. Hence, it is important to look at life not just from one single perspective. Philosophers, scholars, poets and authors have written much about what constitutes living and more importantly what are the necessary items that define someone’s life. Ofcourse this exercise has been done in various ways. While philosophers would try to find the meaning and purpose behind the life of individuals, poets and authors would document the richness of life at various stages. Life is thus perhaps something that is more than intriguing.</p></section>
      <section id="s2"> <h3>SECTION 2</h3> <p>"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people's thinking." -Steve Jobs.<p></p>Wordsworth had remarked long ago that our lives are a reflection of the lives in heaven. While many might find that too far-fetched, life is nevertheless very precious. Had it not been so, none would have made efforts to cling on to it as long as possible. The one thing about life that is integral to it is existence. Life includes existence and without existence life cannot happen. Existence is however sometimes challenging. There are many who do not have the fortune to get good education, there are some who do not have access to food and shelter."</p></section>
      <section id="s3"> <h3>SECTION 3</h3> <p>"If you set your goals ridiculously high and it's a failure, you will fail above everyone else's success." -James Cameron".<p></p>None of these outlooks can be said to be better or worse in terms of the other. It shows how people look at their individual lives as well as the life of others around them so as to make a sense of what they do with their existence on earth. Meaning and purpose however are both difficult to find. Experiences are a major part of life. In fact it guides an individual through his life till his death. Each experience is a lesson for those who come by it. Some intend to learn from their experiences while others tend to ignore it. Experiences are what make it difficult for someone to find the meaning and purpose of his life.</p></section>
